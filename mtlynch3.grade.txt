__TA-COMMENTS-IF-ANY__
	Due to confusion regarding the expected output files, credit is awarded if your output either matches the expected output or surpasses it.
  Points are determined by whether your code performs in the spirit scope of the assignment, not based on exactly matching the expected output. 

c.py
  Your output is nearly correct; you have a slightly violation of rule 1, 'l' adjancent to 'gg' should not be devoiced according to the rules since 'g' is a doubleable consonant. -0.1

b.py
  One of the lines of your output appears to get cutoff for some reason:

expected:	sivuɮiim̥ɬu puŋuum piŋɑtun ɑjuqəɮʁiiməŋ piɮɣuuq tɑzikn̥ɑ

output:		       m̥ɬu puŋuum piŋɑtun ɑjuqəɮʁiiməŋ piɮɣuuq tɑzikn̥ɑ 

  I'm not entirely sure why. Minor issure: -0.1

a.py
  NOT ATTEMPTED
