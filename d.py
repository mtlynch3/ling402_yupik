# Write a Python program that accepts text from standard input,
# lowercases it, and tokenizes it into Yupik graphemes.
#
# Punctuation outside words should be disregarded.
#
# Punctuation within words (apostrophes, etc) is used to separate distinct graphemes
# when they would otherwise be confusable.
#
# For example, "n" followed by "g" would be indicated "n'g" to prevent confusion with "ng"
